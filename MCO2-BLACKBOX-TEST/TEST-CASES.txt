MCO2 TEST CASES (does not include test for the bonus portion)

1.  TEST1.CMD
       A.TXT given sample graph in MCO2 specs; test for a graph with just 1 vertex, 0 edge

2.  TEST2.CMD
    B.TXT test for a graph with max. of 20 vertices 

3.  TEST3.CMD
    C.TXT test for a disconnected graph, i.e., not all vertices will be traversed

4.  TEST4.CMD
    D.TXT test for a disconnected graph (D.TXT and E.TXT contain the same data as C.TXT)

5.  TEST5.CMD
    E.TXT test for a disconnected graph (D.TXT and E.TXT contain the same data as C.TXT)

6.  TEST6.CMD
    G.TXT given sample graph in MCO2 specs

7.  TEST7.CMD
    G.TXT test for a start vertex not found (for BFS & DFS traversal)

8.  TEST8.CMD
